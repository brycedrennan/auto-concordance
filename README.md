# Auto-Concordance üîçüìöüîó

**Discover the hidden connections within texts.**

Automatically generate a concordance for a set of books. Uses text embeddings to find relationships between texts.

## Features
1. Text embedding analysis: The project utilizes text embeddings to analyze and find relationships between texts.
2. Automatic concordance generation: The software automatically generates a concordance for a set of books or texts.
3. Relationship identification: The project identifies and highlights hidden connections within texts.
4. Efficient processing: The software is designed to process large volumes of text efficiently.
5. User-friendly interface: The project provides a user-friendly interface for easy interaction and navigation.
6. Customization options: The software allows users to customize the concordance generation process according to their specific requirements.

## Getting started
```bash
pip install auto-concordance
```
Here is an example usage of the Auto-Concordance project:

```python
from auto_concordance.concordance import generate_concordance

# Define a list of books or texts
texts = [
    "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.",
    "A quick brown dog jumps over a lazy fox.",
    "The lazy dog is brown and the fox is quick.",
]

# Generate a concordance for the texts
concordance = generate_concordance(texts)

# Print the concordance
for word, occurrences in concordance.items():
    print(f"{word}: {occurrences}")
```

This example demonstrates how to use the `generate_concordance` function from the `auto_concordance.concordance` module to generate a concordance for a set of books or texts. The function takes a list of texts as input and returns a dictionary where the keys are words and the values are the number of occurrences of each word in the texts. The example then prints the concordance, displaying each word and its occurrences.
